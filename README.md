# Project Ideas 
List of project ideas I would like to implement or see implemented. Open and looking for collaboration. Some of these ideas might already be implemented somewhere by someone, don't hesitate to 

## Data Science
### Pandas pre-join visualiser


### F-string multi-line pretty formatting 
The f-string is lacking at least one feature that would make them even better:  
the ability to align different lines on specific character. 


### Scikit-Learn : invert transform for specific columns
Having a method to apply the inverse transform method on a transformed columned.
For exemple, once having used `StandardScaler().transform(data)`, being able to apply a function like `StandardScaler().inverse_transform(data)`
video anmiation sync on bpm
site animations live on bpm

## App
### Receipt Manager
Mobile app stocking receipt, under picture or form formats. With an OCR, key information should be read and stored in a structured database.
The goal is to eventually have democratized a dematerialized receipt system, certainly using public and private keys.

## Low bandwith web
A browser and/or a web extension allowing to reduce the bandwith (no animation, small versions of images or none, no tracking) while keeping responsivity and UI/UX.
