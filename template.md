## The pitch
In one or two lines, describe the project. Should give a little more details than the name of the issue, but not too much more.

## Why
This is really important. We don't want build stuff to fill a portfolio. A project should always aim to solve a real problem. <br>
Tell some things explaining why there is a need. Where does the problem takes from ? You should give a state-of-the-art review.
A (fictional or true) little story will always help make the reason behind the idean. For example, you could do a little of storytelling of an actual use case.

## How
If you have any idea how to atually implement your idea, please share.

### Architecture design
What is the structure of the project ? If you know how to draw diagrams, this is great! Otherwise, try to explain with  concise sentences.

### Mock-up
Do you have an UI in mind that you could rapidly sketch (by hand, with Figma, ...) ?

### Existing support
What is out there and could help us succesfully implement the project ? What technology seems particularly suited to address the conception ? What blog post or research article could give us precise insight on what we are trying to achieve?

### Complexity and required time
Do we need to know a lot about programming ? About designing complex software ? How long should it take ? Do we need a long-term planner ?
